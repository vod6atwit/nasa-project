### **Introduction**

nasa project is a full-stack web application used to launch spaceX rocket to the Kepler habitable Planets

Live application hosted on AWS EC2 instances, deploy using Docker image <a href="http://3.95.188.251:8000/" target="_blank">nasa project</a>

### **Features:**

- Able to launch a rocket to Kepler Habitable Planets via control center
- Able to see upcoming launch with date, mission, rocket and destination
- Able to aborts the mission
- Able to see history after aborting the mission or successful launch
- Get real upcoming and history launch of spaceX company by implemented call rest API
  Source: <a href="https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API" >https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API</a>
- Fitler out several Habitable Planets in kepler_data.csv
- Implemented MVC pattern
- Implemented PM2, Docker and EC2 instances
- Implemented Github Workflow using yml file
- Implemented testing using SuperTest library and JEST

**MVC architecture:**

The MVC architecture used here, is a way to structure the application development in three layers:

- <ins>Business logic layer:</ins> represented in Model folder, with mongoose schema choosing which information and data
  represnting to clients and is the layer that the hole application build around.
- <ins>Application logic layer:</ins> represented in Controler files, build around javascript functions to handle application's requests interact with models and send back response to clients.
- <ins>Presentation logic layer:</ins> represented in public folder consists basically of the templates used to generate the view, so the website that we're going to send back to the clients.
